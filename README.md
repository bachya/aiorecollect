`aiorecollect` is a Python 3, asyncio-based library for the ReCollect Waste API. It
allows users to programmatically retrieve schedules for waste removal in their area,
including trash, recycling, compost, and more.

Special thanks to @stealthhacker for the inspiration!

# Installation

```bash
pip install aiorecollect
```

# Python Versions

`aiorecollect` is currently supported on:

- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11

# Place and Service IDs

To use `aiorecollect`, you must know both your ReCollect Place and Service IDs.

In general, cities/municipalities that utilize ReCollect will give you a way to
subscribe to a calendar with pickup dates. If you examine the iCal URL for this
calendar, the Place and Service IDs are embedded in it:

```
webcal://recollect.a.ssl.fastly.net/api/places/PLACE_ID/services/SERVICE_ID/events.en-US.ics
```

# Usage

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import date

from aiorecollect import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Run."""
    client = await Client("<PLACE ID>", "<SERVICE ID>")

    # The client has a few attributes that you can access:
    client.place_id
    client.service_id

    # Get all pickup events on the calendar:
    pickup_events = await client.async_get_pickup_events()

    # ...or get all pickup events within a certain date range:
    pickup_events = await client.async_get_pickup_events(
        start_date=date(2020, 10, 1), end_date=date(2020, 10, 31)
    )

    # ...or just get the next pickup event:
    next_pickup = await client.async_get_next_pickup_event()


asyncio.run(main())
```

## The `PickupEvent` Object

The `PickupEvent` object that is returned from the above calls comes with three
properties:

- `date`: a `datetime.date` that denotes the pickup date
- `pickup_types`: a list of `PickupType` objects that will occur with this event
- `area_name`: the name of the area in which the event is occurring

## The `PickupType` Object

The `PickupType` object contains the "internal" name of the pickup type _and_ a
human-friendly representation when it exists:

- `name`: the internal name of the pickup type
- `friendly_name`: the humany-friendly name of the pickup type (if it exists)

## Connection Pooling

By default, the library creates a new connection to ReCollect with each coroutine. If
you are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second
of runtime savings possible), an
[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection
pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aiorecollect import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Run."""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        client = await Client("<PLACE ID>", "<SERVICE ID>", session=session)

        # Get to work...


asyncio.run(main())
```
